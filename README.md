# -Ironhack-Module-1-Project---Abacuc-Mendez-

In this project I will work with data of FORBES LIST.

In this project I have cleaned the dataset, I have enriched the database using one sources. The first one consist in current data of billionaires through an api that generate a json. The second one I obtain the data with web scraping. This two sources help us to obtain additional data and features about the billionaires.

The web I've used is 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population'

Finally I create a .pdf documents that shows the category business with the highest number of people in that list.
